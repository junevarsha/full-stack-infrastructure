UNDERSTANDING INTERNET

how does internet work?
computers talk to each other

A system of globally interconnected devices - internet
Private Internet - Intranet


HOW DOES INTERNET WORK?

IP Address
tcp - lossless
udps - one way dataflow
ping


DNS:

Trust system - ICANN
domain name - you pay to icann - internet phone book
DNS - closest server to resolve the domain name to ip Address

Nameservers: - actual entity that keeps the domain to ip address mapping

Hey varsha just got espressoandcroissant.com - its not pointing anywhere but if
you wanna look it up, I know exactly where it is.

(namesevers - record keepers of the internet)

ping and traceroute
 - > ICMP

some sites deny ping
 blackholing - just like a cool person ignoring you at a party

Packet:
smallest bit of information
like envelop - basic info - contains metadata

tcp - error correcting
udp - just broadcasting data (like kupa)

EVERYTHING RUNS ON TRUST

Net neutrality - my understanding is it is kind of 
like bribing for internent?
