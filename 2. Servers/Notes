VIM - Vi improved

:set number 

data centers -  renewable energy - wind farms

Cloud - data center - elastic - scale up & down

pay for what you need

server is divided into chunks
chunks - virtual private server
(process isolation, chunks dont know about each other)

Unix -> Linux 

Operating Systems

Kernel -> talks to machine hardware
Instead of baking everything to OS
we bake Utilities

Utilities -> applications that just do one thing

Long Term Support (LTS version)

for production - always use LTS
netflix uses LTS node 
downside is if node supports top-lvl asynch await 
we cant use it until it moves to LTS node

SSH

ssh -i fsfe root@192.81.217.142
ssh root@192.81.217.142 -v
