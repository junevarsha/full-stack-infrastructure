# 1. Introduction

Full Stack: someone who can build application from start -> finish

Command Line: Not all servers have GUIs. GUI is not powerful enough

Shell: Command interpreter to interface with system

Terminal: Runs shell applications

Shell -> application -> Kernel

## Understanding the internet

A system of globally interconnected devices. Computers talk to each other.

Private Internet - Intranet

## How does the internet work?

IP Address: label assigned to internet connected device
(IPV4/IPV6)

TCP - lossless (HEY(SYN) ACK...)

UDP - one way dataflow (hey and i assume you heard me)

PING - just does HEY HEY HEY

## Domain Name System

Trust system - ICANN - you pay to icann - internet phone book

DNS - closest server will resolve the domain name to ip Address

Subdomain vs path - subdomain means different site(partition) - path is just another route

Nameservers - actual entity that keeps the domain to ip address mapping.

    > Varsha just got espressoandcroissant.com - its not pointing anywhere but if
    you wanna look it up, I know exactly where it is.
    (namesevers - record keepers of the internet)

ping and traceroute - ICMP - health checks

some sites deny ping - blackholing - just like a cool person ignoring you at a party

Packet - smallest bit of information
like envelop - basic info - contains metadata

tcp - error correcting

udp - just broadcasting data, faster(like kupa)

Net neutrality - my understanding is it is kind of like bribing for internet?

EVERYTHING RUNS ON TRUST
